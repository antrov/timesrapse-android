# Timesrapse

Another one application for making photos with some given interval. Exciting.

Requires Android SDK 26. Uses AlarmManager and Camera2API.

## Why?

All of the timelapse apps I have found on Google Play works like a standard camera app: some preview, some settings and some problems to work in the background. 

I planned to left an Android phone alone, without internet, sometimes without power supply, for period longer than 2 months. I don't care about _Instant gratification_ like [Microsoft Hyperlapse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=pl&gl=US) or about filters like in [Lapse It](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro&hl=pl&gl=US) prefer to have more control of output file size than like in [Framelapse Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neximolabs.droidtimelapsepro&hl=pl&gl=US).

## Beautiful, isn't it?
